#OVERVIEW:
This project is a simple C program that converts a decimal number into its corresponding binary, octal, and hexadecimal representations.
It is designed to strengthen fundamental programming concepts and number system understanding.
#FEATURES:
1.Decimal to Binary conversion

2.Decimal to Octal conversion

3.Decimal to Hexadecimal conversion

4.Menu-driven program for easy user interaction
#CONCEPTS USED:
1.Functions

2.Loops (for)

3.Conditional statements

4.Recursion (for hexadecimal conversion)

5.Modulus operator (%)

6.Input / Output operations
#PROGRAM FLOW:
1.User enters a decimal number

2.User selects the desired conversion type

3.The corresponding conversion function is called

4.The converted value is displayed on the console
#SAMPLE OUTPUT:
ENTER THE DECIMAL NUMBER YOU WANT TO CONVERT: 56
CHOOSE CONVERSION TYPE: B - Binary O - Octal H - Hexadecimal
H
38
#How to Run:

1.Clone the repository

2.Compile the program using a C compiler:

gcc number_system_conversion.c

3.Run the executable:

./a.out
#Learning Outcome:

1.Clear understanding of number systems

2.Improved logical thinking

3.Better use of functions and recursion in C
